"Megan was so wonderful to work with. I was a bride who did NOT know what she wanted and Megan walked me through it all. She helped me figure out my vibe for the invites which then translated into the entire wedding because I liked it so much! She was super responsive and helpful and I ended up with a product that was super unique to me. I got tons of compliments on them because they were so 'me' :)" - Maria, Jordan, MN
